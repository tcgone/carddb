  - Play Mysterious Fossil as if it were a Basic Pokémon. While in play, Mysterious
    Fossil counts as a Pokémon (instead of a Trainer card). Mysterious Fossil has
    no attacks, can't retreat, and can't be Asleep, Confused, Paralyzed, or Poisoned.
    If Mysterious Fossil is Knocked Out, it doesn't count as a Knocked Out Pokémon.
    (Discard it anyway.) At any time during your turn before your attack, you may
    discard Mysterious Fossil from play.
